# debug-node
Assignment for new developers to learn about node's command line errors and how to use them.

##Getting Started
1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Clone** this repository from your personal Github account:
    - Copy the HTTPS or SSH address on the page.
    - From you DevLeague folder, run the command `$ git clone [SSH or HTTP address]` in your terminal in order to clone this repository into that folder 
      (you don't need to type the "$"; this is the command __prompt__, and is used to signify your terminal is ready for commands).
3. From your terminal, navigate into the debug-node assignment:
    - `$ cd debug-node`
4. From your terminal, run the fixer-upper file with node:
    - `$ node fixer-upper.js`
5. Read the terminal's response. Breathe deeply. Don't freak out. Use the information provided to locate the error and fix it. Save and run the file with node again. 
6. Rinse and repeat until the file is completely debugged.
